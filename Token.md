Stages of token sale
====================

Private pre-sale
----------------

A contract has a function `approve(_address, _limit, _pricePerEther)` that sets a limit and price for private sale participant .

* address of a buyer from which we will accept payment
* max ether value to accept
* price in DBrain tokens per ether

Before public sale starts we will mint tokens to the saved addresses.

Public pre-sale
----------------

It should be just a part of normal sale and limited by the number of minted tokens. The price of DBN should gradually increase.

Main sale
---------------
